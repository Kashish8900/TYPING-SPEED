# TYPING-SPEED
This Typing Speed Test website helps users improve their typing speed and accuracy through an interactive and engaging interface. Users can choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard levels, each containing multiple dynamic paragraphs, and can refresh paragraphs to practice with new text. The site tracks live Words Per Minute (WPM) and accuracy.

      1.Total words typed
      2.Time taken
      3.Words per minute (WPM)
